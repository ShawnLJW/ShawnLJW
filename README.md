# Shawn J. W. Lee
I want robots to take over the world.

The world we live in has been shaped by human intelligence, but our future will be shaped by Artificial Intelligence. AI is changing the world and my mission is to support it. I apply cutting-edge AI research to solve real-world problems.

I'm especially interested in Deep Generative Modeling. Generative models such as diffusion models, Generative Adversarial Networks, and variational autoencoders learn to generate new content by discovering the underlying structure of training data. They are one of the most promising approaches to achieving Artificial General Intelligence.

Currently, I study Machine Learning and Data Science at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
