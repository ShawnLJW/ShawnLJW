# Shawn J. W. Lee
I am an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer excited by the breakthroughs made in AI research. I enjoy working on projects that solve real-world problems using state of the art methods. I take pride in my ability to develop new and creative ideas.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most revolutionary field of study in this decade. It’s exciting that even with all the breakthroughs made in the last ten years, there’s still much more to be discovered. My goal is to make an impact on this field of increasing importance in the modern world. I dream of the day when AI can solve what humans cannot.
